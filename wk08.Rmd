# Tuesday: Bivariate Inference 

Goals: 

* Review how we use the normal distribution to compare two means, and two proportions. 
* Conduct these analyses in your software program of choice. Understand how to read the output. 

## Prepare 

* Read Section 5.3 (difference of two means) and 6.2 (difference of two proportions) in the Open Intro textbook. There are several videos that accompany these section. 
    - The PMA5 book covers primarily multivariable analyses techniques. Not bivariate.  

## In class

* Review two sample t-tests in preparation for multiple group comparisons. 
* Using the variables chosen in your foundations worksheet - conduct a test of means and proportions in your software program of choice. Learn how to read the output. 

## Resources

* [CHOOSING THE CORRECT STATISTICAL TEST IN SAS, STATA, SPSS AND R] https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/whatstat/

# Thursday: ANOVA
Goals: 

* Describe why ANOVA is better than multiple comparisons
* Conduct an ANOVA in your software program of choice and interpret the results. 


## Prepare
* Read Section 5.5 (comparing many means) in Open Intro textbook. Watch the associated videos. 
* Introduce yourself to the [Bivariate Inference](hw/Bivariate_Inference.html) Assignment. 
    - Here is a [[PDF]](hw/Bivariate_Inference.pdf) version if you would like to print/annotate. 

## In class

* Discuss how analyzing the ratio of variances can tell you about the group means. 
* Conduct and interpret an ANOVA using your software program of choice. 
* Introduction to the bivariate inference assignment. 


##### Assignments
* [Bivariate Inference](hw/Bivariate_Inference.html) Assignment.
    - R code [template](hw/bivariate_Inference_template.Rmd) -- to be used by the R users.
