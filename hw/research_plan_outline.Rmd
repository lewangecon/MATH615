Your research plan is an important component of your final research project. Not only is it worth about 10% of your project grade, it will also act as the basis for your final poster. You will spend the next several weeks writing your research plan. Before you do that, however, it is important to have an outline in place. For this assignment, you will use the outline template below to begin thinking about how your research plan paper will come together. The reading [writing about empirical research](https://norcalbiostat.netlify.com/lec/lec_writing_em/) can help guide your writing. 

Follow the template below to complete this assignment. Post your finalized (spell checked, reviewed) document as a blog post. You are also assigned to review two of your classmates outlines using the 1up1down method of review. 


# Title
* Your title should summarize the main idea of your research question.
* Must include the variables under investigation.
* Must be fully explanatory when standing alone. 
* Include the terms “association between” or “relationship between” in your title to join your variables of interest.  
 

# Introduction 
* Opening statement or questions (grab the reader)
    - This statement introduces your topic and gives your rationale for the study.
        * This is going to be a working opening statement that will develop more as you go.	
* Literature review
    - Type a basic outline of topics you know you will need to discuss to be able to identify major trends in the literature and emphasize major findings
        * As you have been reading you should have been seeing some of the same topics/findings/themes reappearing, these would be good topics to put into a basic outline.


# Method
* Name data set and at least 3 key features of the sample or way data were collected.
    - One outline point for each of your variables. 
      * What are they and how were they measured?
 

# Predicted Results
* At least 2 outline points stating how you think your variables will be related/associated. 
    - Look back to your research questions and think about “answering” them.
