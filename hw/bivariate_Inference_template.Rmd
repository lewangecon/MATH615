# Analysis of Variance


1. **Identify response and explanatory variables**


2. **Visualize and summarise bivariate relationship** 


3. **Write the relationship you want to examine in the form of a research question.**


4. **Perform an appropriate statistical analysis.**
 
    I. 
Let $\mu_{i}$ 

    II. 
$H_{0}: \mu_{1} = \mu_{2} = \mu_{3}$   
$H_{A}:$ At least one group mean is different. 


    III.
