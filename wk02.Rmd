# Data Cleaning
Goals: 

* Learn how to identify mistakes and missing data in data using tables and summaries
* Learn how to correct certain mistakes
* Learn how to recode variables into new ones

## Prepare 
* Review the [data prep notes](docs/lec02_data_prep.html) 
* Have the depression data set ready for processing in your SPC. 
    - Also have the codebook open. 


## In class
* "Clean" the depression data set (`depress`). This may take more than one class period. 
* Any remaining in class time will be spent cleaning the Add Health data

##### Assignments
* Explore some variables within your chosen sections of Add Health (**Due 8/31**)
    - Blog about what variables you chose and why
    - Discuss any recoding you think you may want to do, or data problems that will have to be fixed. (_Think about the data management questions in lec02_) 
* Start a data management file for the Add Health data (you can start with the version that is on my raw data page if you like)
    - This must be a single script file that imports the data, does cleaning, and saves the cleaned data set with a new name. (**Due 9/4**)
    - It does not have to be comprehensive! I just want to make sure you are getting started in a reproducible manner. 
* Citation assignment (**Due 9/4**) [[Instructions]](hw/Citation_Assignment.html)
    - [Example submission](docs/Citation Assignment Example.pdf)
