* Have the depression data set ready for processing in your SPC. 
    - Also have the codebook open. 

### In class
* "Clean" the depression data set (`depress`) 
    

### Assignments
* Explore some variables within your chosen sections of Add Health
    - Blog about what variables you chose and why
    - Discuss any recoding you think you may want to do, or data problems that will have to be fixed. 
    - Provide evidence of these problems using screenshots and code

## Thursday: Univariate Data Visualizations
Goals: 

* Learn how to create and interpret univariate data graphics

### Prepare 
* Review both the following items. 
    - [PMA6 Data Viz ch DRAFT](docs/pma6_ch4_draft.pdf)
    - [R Data Viz overview](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH130/materials/day56-data-viz.html). Yes even SPSS users should look at this.
* Try to reproduce all univariate graphics and tables in your SPC. 
    - These examples use the `parhiv` and `depress` data sets. 
    
### In class

* Discuss interpretations for all univariate graphics. 

### Assignments

* Create and interpret appropriate univariate graphics for 5 variables in Add Health. 2 continuous, 1 ordinal, 1 nominal, 1 binary. 
    - It would be ideal if the chosen variables are among your list of selected sections/variables but this is not mandatory. 
    - Blog about it
