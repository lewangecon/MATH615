# Week 3 9/4 - 9/10

##  Univariate Data Visualizations
Goals: 

* Learn how to create univariate data graphics
* Describe the distribution of a single variable in sentence form using summary statistics and pointing out specific features of the graphics as evidence to support your interpretation. 

### Prepare 
* Review both the following items. 
    - [PMA6 Data Viz ch DRAFT](docs/pma6_ch4_draft.pdf)
    - [Data Viz tutorial](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH130/materials/day56-data-viz.html). 
* Prepare your computer to use either the `parhiv` and/or `depress` data sets, or the `dsmall` subsample of the `diamonds` data set (also available for download on my [cleaned data](https://norcalbiostat.netlify.com/data/cleaned_data/) page)
          

### In class
* Reproduce all univariate graphics and tables in your SPC. 
    - The examples in PMA6 use the `parhiv` and `depress` data sets. 
    - The examples in Data viz tutorial use the `diamonds` data set that comes with `ggplot2` package. 
* Discuss interpretations for all univariate graphics.

### Assignments

* Create and interpret appropriate univariate graphics for 5 variables in Add Health. 2 continuous, 1 ordinal, 1 nominal, 1 binary. 
    - It would be ideal if the chosen variables are among your list of selected sections/variables but this is not mandatory. 
    - Blog about it. Post the graphics, and english interpretations using summary statistcs to provide context.
