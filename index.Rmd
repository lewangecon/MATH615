# Announcements

### 8/27/17 - Week 2

This week we're going to get our hands dirty with data!

* Using the `depression` data set from the textbook, we're going to learn what types of data preparation steps are common. 
* We'll practice in class making these changes on the depression data, then you'll work on _your_ Add Health variables in the same way. 
* On Thursday we'll talk about doing a literature review and proper citation, and then the rest of the period will be open work time. 

#### Housekeeping

* Office hours have been set. Thank you for contributing! MW 3-4pm, TR 10-11am, and by appointment. 
* The syllabus has been updated to correctly reflect grade distribution and office hours
* I have written up instructions regarding how to peer review blog posts. Check the project page (new!) for details and your assignments. 
* The schedule page has been tweaked in attempt to be a little cleaner/easier to read.
