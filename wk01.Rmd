# Tuesday: Introduction to the class
Goals: 

* Understand how to navigate the course website resources
* Create learning support groups
* Understand what statistical programming software options are available to you, and what support systems they come with. 
* Understand the concept of reproducible research and why it's important. Understand at what level reproducibility is expected in this class. 

## Prepare before class
* Read the [Syllabus](docs/syllabus_615_f17.html)
* Bookmark this class website 
* Purchase the [textbook](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Multivariate-Analysis-Chapman-Statistical/dp/1439816808) (PMA5). Pricey, but one of those books that you are likely to keep as a reference textbook. 
* Read [Passion Driven Statistics](docs/PDS_Intro_Stat.pdf) (ignore last page about timeline)
* Review [these slides](http://benmarwick.github.io/UW-eScience-reproducibility-social-sciences/#/) on reproducible research in the social sciences.


## In class
* [Introduction to the class](docs/lec01_intro_class.html) notes
* Discuss logistics and software options


## Resources


##### Assignments
* Create a MATH615 folder on your computer - all course related files go in here. 
* Create a Blog on BBLearn. Post an introduction/bio of yourself. 
* Decide on the software program you will use. 
    - Review the support options above before making your decision.  
    - You are welcome to switch at any time, but acknowledge it will be hard (but not impossible) to get caught up. 
* Second blog post: Write up a plan for how you will conduct reproducible research in this class. Be explicit and detailed, consider these instructions for a "you" in 6 months. 
* Read PMA5 Ch 2. Here is a [scanned PDF](docs/PMA5 Ch 2 and 3.pdf) if you don't have the book yet.
    - Prepare answers to PMA5 problems 2.2 & 2.7
