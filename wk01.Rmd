# Tuesday: Introduction to the class
Goals: 

* Understand how to navigate the course website resources
* Create learning support groups
* Understand what statistical programming software options are available to you, and what support systems they come with. 
* Understand the concept of reproducible research and why it's important. Understand at what level reproducibility is expected in this class. 

## Prepare before class
* Read the [Syllabus](docs/syllabus_615_f17.html)
* Bookmark this class website 
* Purchase the [textbook](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Multivariate-Analysis-Chapman-Statistical/dp/1439816808) (PMA5). Pricey, but honestly one of those books that you are likely to keep as a reference textbook. 
* Read [Passion Driven Statistics](docs/PDS_Intro_Stat.pdf) (ignore last page about timeline). We are going to take a similar approach in this class to conducting an analysis. 
* Review [these slides](http://benmarwick.github.io/UW-eScience-reproducibility-social-sciences/#/) on reproducible research in the social sciences.


## In class
* [Introduction to the class](docs/lec01_intro_class.html) notes
* Discuss logistics and software options

##### Assignments
* Create a MATH615 folder on your computer - all course related files go in here. 
* Blog post: Introduction/bio of yourself. 
    - What's your research area?
    - One non-academic interest or hobby
* Decide on the software program you will use. (Due before next Tuesday)
    - Review the support options above before making your decision.  
    - You are welcome to switch at any time, but acknowledge it will be hard (but not impossible) to get caught up.
    - Get your laptop ready to analyze data by next Tuesday. 
* Blog post (2): Reproducible research plan.
    - Write up a plan for how you will conduct reproducible research in this class.
    - Be explicit and detailed, consider these instructions for a "you" in 6 months. (yes these plans can, and will change)
* Read PMA5 Ch 2. Here is a [scanned PDF](docs/PMA5 Ch 2 and 3.pdf) if you don't have the book yet.

# Thursday: Orientating yourself to data
Goals: 

* Identify different data types according to Stevens's Classifications. 
* Understand how to use a data dictionary (codebook)
* Learn about the Add Health data that you will be analyzing this semester. 

## Prepare
* Read the Personal Codebook Assignment [[instructions]](hw/RQ_personal_codebook_assignment.html)
* Download the following data sets and codebooks from my [data](https://norcalbiostat.netlify.com/data/raw_data/) page into a `MATH615/data` subfolder on your computer. 
    - Add Health.csv
    - ParHIV.xlsx
    - depress.txt
    
We'll use the Add Health codebook today, but the others next week. So might as well grab all while you're there. 

## In class
* Medical Record data entry and codebook creation
* Personal Codebook Assignment

##### Assignments
* Review the AddHealth codebook front matter and choose 3-5 areas of interest. (**Blog post due 8/28**)
* Personal Codebook and Research Question Assignment (**Due 9/4**)
* Read PMA5 Ch3 (Preparing Data for Analysis)
* Read next week's overview so you know how to prepare for Tuesday.
