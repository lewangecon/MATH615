# Navigating course resources
* My website: http://norcalbiostat.com
    - First stop for all class materials
    - Links to individual classes, but shared resources on programming and data. 
* This class website https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH615/ 
    - Landing page for announcements
    - Details on weekly topics can be found on the schedule
    - Includes links to notes, assignments and additional materials
* Both are mobile friendly. 
* Often links will be broken. Typo's happen. Notify me immediately and I'll get to it asap. 
* The syllabus covers course details such as grading, office location and classroom policies. 


# Online systems

* Blackboard Learn (BBL) used for recording grades only.
* Assignments will be turned and peer reviewed through Google Drive. 
* The textbook used for data, reading and learning content. Sometimes problem sets. 
    - Great long term resource, but a new edition will be coming out next year. 
* Slack will be used for outside class discussions, homework help and general chatter. 
    - I will not answer programming questions through email. 
    - Download either the phone app or the desktop app (I use both) 
    - Push notifications are not automatically turned on. You must opt in. 

# Assignment process
* When available, use the template provided. 
* All assignments are uploaded as PDF's to our shared Google Drive. 
   - Each assignment has it's own folder. 
   - Assignments are uploaded to the _Incoming_ folder, and returned in the _Reviewed_ folder. 
   - File naming convention: `userid_assignment.pdf` i.e. `rdonatello_citation.pdf` 
   - No special characters or spaces in your file names. 
* Each assignment will be graded by me, and peer reviewed by 2 of your classmates. 

## Peer review
* The peer rotation schedule can be found [[here]](). 
* After the assignment due date, go to the _Incoming_ folder and **download** a copy of each of the 2 assignments you are scheduled to review onto your computer. 
    - Do not edit directly in Google Docs unless you have already made a copy
    - File naming convention: `rdonatello_citation_rv_ricardo.pdf`
* Use the commenting features of Adobe PDF to make any corrections or comments 
    - You must mention **two** things that are good about the assignment and **two** things that need improvement or corrections. 
    - Be specific about each edit. Don't just say "great job". 
    - Give the type of feedback and review that you want others to give to you. 

# Descriptive vs. Inferential Statistics
* Two main phases of Statistics. 
* Also called Exploratory and Confirmatory 
* [Passion Driven Statistics](../reading/PDS_Intro_Stat.pdf) 
    - Backbone theory behind the class. Read this PDF to get a sense of how statistics fits into science. 
    - The videos can be used as an additional learning tool. 
* Google `data analysis lifecycle` and look at images. What sense do you get? 


# Computing and Reproducibility

* No more TI-83, modern statistics is computational based. 
* Big push for open research in the Natural Sciences. 
    - Sharing code & data. Sometimes required along with manuscript for publishing. 
* Reproducibility. Give someone else access to your data and code, and they can replicate your findings. 
    - We will practice this in this class. 
    - I practice this by putting all class material online with a cc-by license. (others are free to copy and share my work with acknowledgement)
* Review these [Slides](http://benmarwick.github.io/UW-eScience-reproducibility-social-sciences/#/) on reproducible research in the social sciences.
    - I will not require any measure of version control or open source coding in this class. 
* Be mindful about file naming conventions (slide 11). Make a plan and stick with it.

* Expect to bring your laptop every day to class. 
    - The more reading and content learning done outside of class, the more time for in class analysis and discussion
    

# Software program of choice (SPC)   
* All my lecture notes use R. This entire website is built with R. I would prefer you to learn R, It will take you much further than other languages. 
    - Your final product is much more professional looking - [here's an student-generated example](../reading/Final_chem_report.pdf)
* I will not dictate which software program you use in this class. 
* But I will expect you to navigate and use code. You can point and click your way to an answer, but code must be saved and reusible with minimal changes. 

## R
* Free. 
* Coding from day 1. Harder up front, more powerful in the end. 
* Seamless integration with a multitude of other scientific analysis and reporting mechanisms. 
* Becoming much more popular in all scientific fields of study. One of the primary languages for Data Science. 
* Google `tidyverse` images. Compare it to the images of the data analysis life cycle. What sense do you get? 
* My [instructions](https://norcalbiostat.netlify.com/post/software-overview/) on how to get setup.
* On campus resources
    - Introduction to R (MATH 130) 1 unit CR/NC
    - Data Science Initiative workshops, talks, open drop in analysis time. 
* Off Campus resources (a few)
    - Chico R Users Group 
        - [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Chico-R-Users-Group/)
        - [Google l-serv](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/chico-rug)
    - [Data camp](http://www.datacamp.com)
    - [Quick-R](http://www.statmethods.net/)
    - [Cookbook for R](http://www.cookbook-r.com/)
    - [R Examples Repository](http://dwoll.de/rexrepos/) (This site was also built using R Markdown, is open source and a fabulous example of reproducible research!)
   
   
## SPSS
* [Purchase v24 or v25](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/spss-stats-gradpack) for $50 for 6mo rental. 
* Point and click, but can save code and write scripts. 
* Stand alone program. No integration. Licenses are not cheap. 
* Will be used again in NSFC 600 (no exp necc for that class either)
* On campus resources: From the desk of David Philhour (BSS) 
    - Open computer labs in Butte Hall (207, 211) with many open lab hours.
    - Tutoring center in AJH108 run by Dr. Penelope Kuhn. 
    - The psyc depth lab is Modoc 224 but is pretty impacted with classes Monday thru Thursday. Friday's are pretty open.
* Off Campus resources

    - [UCLA IDRE PMA5 textbook examples](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/examples/pma5/)

## SAS? STATA? Python? 
* SAS has only now working on literate and integrated programming by using Jupyter notebooks and SAS University Edition (free)
* SPSS has a few user written packages that allow for the integration of $\latex$ or markdown into your code document. 
* Python is the other primary language for Data Science. I am in the process of learning Python but the capabilities are very great. If you're thinking this route be sure to use Jupyter notebooks.
