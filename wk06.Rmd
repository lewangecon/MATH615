# Tuesday: Choosing Appropriate Analysis
Goals: 

* Identify dependent and independent variables
* Identify appropriate choices for analysis for each combiation of data types
* Start your presentation slides file in Google Drive. 

## Prepare 
* Read PMA5 Chapter 5
* Review new items on project page. 

## In class

### Selecting appropriate analysis

**Considerations:**

* Purpose of analysis.  
* Types of variables in data set.  
* Data used in analysis.   
* Assumptions needed; satisfied?  
* Choice of analyses is often arbitrary: consider several  

**Example:** 

5 independent variables: 3 interval, 1 ordinal, 1 nominal  

1 dependent variable: interval

Analysis options  

- Multiple regression: pretend independent ordinal variable is an
  interval variable use dummy (0 /1) variables for nominal variables
- Analysis of variance: categorize all independent variables
- Analysis of covariance: leave variables as is, check assumptions
- Logistic regression: Categorize dependent variable: high, low
- Survival analysis: IF dependent variable is time to an event

Unsure? Do several and compare results. 


### Poster Peparation
- Introduce new additions to project page.
